Totally not malware

This doesn't actually do anything dangerous, at worst it will lock the victim in a fullscreen window after they click the close or minimize button. If the version running has the `BLOCK_KEYS` bool set True, it will try and block a bunch of different hotkeys from doing anything.

To close the program, you can try entering semi-valid input or typing `exit` in the `Security Code` input box, then pressing the button. If this does not work, you may need to restart the computer or try and open task manager (assuming task manager is set to always on top).

The program will also create a shortcut in the startup folder called `WindowsUpdate.lnk` this will point to `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Windows Update.exe`, you can delete these after restarting your computer and it should be gone.
